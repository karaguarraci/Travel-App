# SEI Project 3 - Design My Trip

This project involved building a MERN full stack app with CRUD functionality. We created a travel app where users could view activities by country and add them to a personal itinerary. Additionally, users could add their own activities to a country and update them. For the back-end API development, we utilised MongoDB and Express. To effectively manage the project, we utilised Jira and Excalidraw to plan and assign tasks.

## Tech Stack

HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React.js | Sass | Express.js | MongoDB | Postman | Bootstrap | JIRA | Excalidraw | Slack

## Project Brief

- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
- Have a visually impressive design
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible

## Timeframe

2 Weeks | Group project

## Planning

Our team decided to create a travel app that allowed users to view activities for each country and add them to their own personal itinerary. 
To begin, we utilised Excalidraw to plan the app's layout and functionality, incorporating potential stretch goals. We then concentrated our efforts on developing the back-end API and utilised Jira to organise tasks and assign responsibilities to individual team members. This allowed us to begin working on our respective tasks independently, while also participating in group coding for more significant tasks. I was assigned the userModel, userController and the Auth middleware in the backend. In the frontend I built the login and country page.
